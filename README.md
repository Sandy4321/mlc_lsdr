Multi-Label Classification with Label Space Dimension Reduction
======

The program consists of four linear label space transformation approaches: Binary Relevance with Random Discarding (BR), Principle Label Space Transformation (PLST), Compressive Sensing (CS), and Conditional Principal Label Space Transformation (CPLST). The base learner used in all approaches is regularized linear regression with a fixed regularization parameter. Please see the usage below.

BR, PLST and CS are compared in

Farbound Tai and Hsuan-Tien Lin. Multilabel classification with principal label space transformation. Neural Computation, 24(9):2508--2542, September 2012.

CPLST is developed in 

Yao-Nan Chen and Hsuan-Tien Lin. Feature-aware label space dimension reduction for multi-label classification. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems: Proceedings of the 2012 Conference (NIPS), pages 1538--1546, December 2012.
